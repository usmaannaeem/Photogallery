Dear sir/madam 

I want to apply for the general assistant position as seen on your website at www.showcaseleeds.com. 

I am interested to work here because watching movies with families are exciting and a good way to relax and switch off from the world.  
This cinema has everything i want my career to have. The amazing atmosphere, friendly staff and benefits like discounted tickets for watching big block buster films. 
Also the duties i will get as a general assistant are exciting and will help me grow as a person. 

Over the past few years I have worked as a catalogue distributor for Betterware and 
furniture packer for MA living. This has developed my sales and customer service skills.
My best achievement has been when I gained back the trust of an angry customer by staying
calm, empathetic and making a good decision of a refund which resulted in more sales.  
Other experiences such as winning a customer also happened.  

Even though I have very little retail experience, i believe that my past experience in sales and customer
service combined with your support will help me become a successful general assistant and 
 an asset to this company.  

 Thankyou for this opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you soon






























I have a deep passion for films, I also come here with family alot which has 
helped me fall in love with its amazing atmosphere, movie theatres and staff members.
